Leveraging ProteomicsDB for the Pharmacoproteomic Characterization of Hemoglobin Subunit Alpha (HBA1): Identification, Stability, and Drug Interactions
# Leveraging ProteomicsDB for the Pharmacoproteomic Characterization of Hemoglobin Subunit Alpha (HBA1)

## 🧬 Project Overview
This repository contains the analysis and data derived from ProteomicsDB for the pharmacoproteomic characterization of **Hemoglobin Subunit Alpha (HBA1)**. The goal is to provide a comprehensive resource detailing HBA1's protein expression, post-translational modifications, interactions, and potential drug-target relationships using large-scale proteomics data.

This project includes the dataset (89.3 MB) and accompanying visualization files extracted directly from ProteomicsDB.

## ⚙️ Usage & Citation
### How to Use the Data
1.  **Clone the Repository:** Download the entire dataset using Git:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/DrNagendra619/Leveraging-ProteomicsDB-for-the-Pharmacoproteomic-Characterization-of-Hemoglobin-Subunit-Alpha-HBA1-.git](https://github.com/DrNagendra619/Leveraging-ProteomicsDB-for-the-Pharmacoproteomic-Characterization-of-Hemoglobin-Subunit-Alpha-HBA1-.git)
    ```
2.  **View Results:** Open the `.html` files (e.g., `HBA1 | ProteomicsDB Summary.html`) directly in your web browser to view the interactive data visualizations.
3.  **Analysis:** Load the `.csv` files into R, Python, or spreadsheet software for custom downstream analysis.
